# RESTROFLOW
RestroFlow is a console-based project built in C++ to automate restaurant ordering and billing. It allows customers to browse menus, place and modify orders, apply discounts, and generate accurate bills ‚Äî making the dining experience faster, smoother, and error-free.

Developed as a Programming Fundamentals (PF) Final Project, RestroFlow demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditionals, and input validation while solving a real-world problem.
